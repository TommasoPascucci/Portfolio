# Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk
## Business problem summary
The Home Credit Default Risk project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a client defaulting on a loan. The problem arises identifying potential customers who may have a high risk of default and without typical tools like credit scores. Lenders often have incomplete or inaccurate information on applicants' financial backgrounds, making it difficult to evaluate credit risk accurately. Defaulting loans can cause financial loss to the company, increase operational costs, and damage the institution's reputation. The goal is to model a way to predict whether clients will default on loans or not.

A reliable predictive model will help Home Credit make better loan approval decisions, reducing the risk of defaults while extending credit to more responsible clients. This will improve profitability, streamline the approval process, and enhance customer satisfaction by offering loans to applicants who may have been previously overlooked.
